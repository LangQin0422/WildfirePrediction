# WildfirePrediction
This is a research project about developing a machine learning model for wildfire magnitude prediction, based on features prior to the happening of the wildfire. The features include temperature, wind, precipitation, and humudity. 

## Files included
1. One PDF file: PaperTeam1.pdf - final draft of the research
2. Three CSV files: 1) FW_Veg_Rem_Combined.csv - original wildfire data; 2) class.csv - preprocessed data extracted from the original data for classification; 3) regress.csv - preprocessed data extracted from the original data for regression
3. Two PNG files: 1) correlation.png - correlation matrix of the original data; 2) preview.png - visulization of missing data
4. One .ipynb file: ImprovedModels.ipynb - further study of the models after the research
* ImprovedModels.ipynb includes: 1) kNeighborsClassifier with k-Fold Cross-Validation, 2) RandomForestClassifier with Cross-Validation, and 3) RidgeClassifier
